        Everybody wants peace, Everybody wants peace until they realize that
        peace means you changing your tone when someone irritates you. No longer
        making everything an argument. Listening before responding. Setting your
        boundaries high and understanding that everyone has their boundaries
        too. Sone of you: you don&#39;t want to be in peace because to be in
        peace means giving it to others. - <em>Unknow</em>

        You pulled me away from my own heart, Replaced it with your own. You
        wrecked and recreated me. I will forever be yours, But you will never be
        mine. I am just another art piece on the wall, In your museum. Waiting
        to be admired by your eyes. - <em>Feeling This Way - Ben Esqueda</em>

        you should&#39;ve left me alone if I wasn&#39;t what you wanted. How
        stupid of me was it to think that you actually saw something in me?
        Taking to someone every single day for hours can be pretty distractive
        because there will come a day where you don&#39;t speak at all, and

        pointless we could&#39;ve just stayed strangers. - <em>dyingful</em>

        Sometimes I wonder why the universe let me met you. Why did it gave me
        the chance to feel you presence. To know you, understand you, and fall
        for you. Even though in the end, I know you will be the reason for my
        biggest sorrow. I mean, how can the universe be so cruel? Why would it
        gave me access to unrequited feelings? -

        Nobody agrees but friendships are more twisted than romance. Romance
        gives you right, romance gives you authority, your lover is just yours
        by oath. That&#39;s not how it goes between two people who lives on
        convenience not desperation. - <em>Unknow</em> <span>Jan 21 2024</span>

      <li>
        I&#39;m paradoxical. I like to be happy but I think about sad things all
        the time. I don&#39;t really like myself but I love the person I&#39;ve
        become. I say I don&#39;t care but I just care too much, deep into my
        bones. I crave attention yet I reject everything that comes my way. I
        healed people, but I broke my own heart trying to fix them. I love to
        listen, but I never tell them what&#39;s inside me. A living
        contradiction. That&#39;s what I am. - <em>Unknow</em>

        Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it
        is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is
        not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight
        in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts,
        always hopes, always perseveres. - <em>Unknow</em>

      <li>
        People want to be acknowledged, accepted, and appreciated. It takes
        almost nothing to give them that, but empires have risen and fell
        because of it. People will be so happy that you&#39;ve given it, even if
        they know they&#39;re being manipulated, they&#39;ll ignore the
        manipulation for the sake of what you&#39;re giving them. -

        I&#39;ve said it before and will say it again. You can seem like a
        millionaire to one person and a homeless person to the next. The ants
        think you are a giant and the trees don&#39;t even notice you. You think
        you have a boring life, but the next person might be striving for your
        lifestyle. Comparison is the thief of joy so just stay kind and keep
        living life. Life is all just a big game of perspective -

        Trust me when I say be the person who cares. Be the person who makes the
        effort, the person who loves without hesitation. Be the person who shows
        up for others. Because there is nothing stronger than someone who
        continues to show kindness in a world that hasn&#39;t always been kind
        to them. - <em>Unknow</em> <span>Nov 3 2023</span>
