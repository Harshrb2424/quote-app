        " When I got enough confidence, the stage was gone.. When I was sure of
        Losing, I won.When I needed People the most, they Left me. When I learnt
        to dry my Tears, I found a shoulder to Cry on. When I mastered the Skill
        of Hating, Someone started Loving me from the core of the Heart. And,
        while waiting for Light for Hours when I fell asleep, the Sun came out..
        That’s LIFE!! No matter what you Plan, you never know what Life has
        Planned for you Success introduces you to the World. But Failure
        introduces the World to you. Always be Happy!! Often when we lose Hope
        and think this is the end God smiles from above and says, “Relax
        Sweetheart; It’s just a Bend, not the End..!"” -

        If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives. Be
        kind anyway.<br />What you spend years building, someone can destroy
        overnight. Build anyway.<br />The good you do today, people will often
        forget tomorrow. Do good anyway.<br />Give the world the the best you
        have and it may never be enough. Give the world the best you've got
        anyway. - <em>orphanage in Calcutta, India.</em>

        Everybody wants peace, Everybody wants peace until they realize that
        peace means you changing your tone when someone irritates you. No longer
        making everything an argument. Listening before responding. Setting your
        boundaries high and understanding that everyone has their boundaries
        too. Sone of you: you don't want to be in peace because to be in peace
        means giving it to others. - <em>Unknown</em> <span>May 12 2024</span>

        Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it
        is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is

        in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts,
        always hopes, always perseveres. - <em>Unknown</em>

        People want to be acknowledged, accepted, and appreciated. It takes
        almost nothing to give them that, but empires have risen and fell
        because of it. People will be so happy that you've given it, even if
        they know they're being manipulated, they'll ignore the manipulation for
        the sake of what you're giving them. - <em>Unknown</em>

        I've said it before and will say it again. You can seem like a
        millionaire to one person and a homeless person to the next. The ants
        think you are a giant and the trees don't even notice you. You think you
        have a boring life, but the next person might be striving for your
        lifestyle. Comparison is the thief of joy so just stay kind and keep
        living life. Life is all just a big game of perspective -

        That's the thing about people who haven't been loves much.....<br />They
        think about every kind gesture, a lightest touch of fingers, kind
        smiles, random acts of live, intimacy in every small thing done.
        <br />They find that love wherever they can because it was never given
        to them freely. <br />They don't ask for love, they search for it
        everywhere. - <em>Unknown</em> <span></span>

        There are 2 kinds of people in the world, Hopeless romantics and
        realists. A realist just sees that face and packs it in with every other
        pretty girl they've seen before. Hopeless romantic becomes convinced
        that god put them on earth to be with that one person. -
